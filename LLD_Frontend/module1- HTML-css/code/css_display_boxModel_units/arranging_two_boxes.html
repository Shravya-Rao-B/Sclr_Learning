/*
You are tasked with creating two overlapping elements using CSS positioning and write internal css following the following instructions:
1. Style the first div element with the class element1 to have a fixed width and height of 100px each.
2. Apply a background color of your choice to element1.
3. Position element1 20px from the top and 20px from the left of its containing element.
4. Style the second div element with the class element2 to have a fixed width and height of 80px each.
5. Apply a different background color to element2.
6. Position element2 so that it overlaps element1 by 10px from the top and 10px from the left of its containing element.
