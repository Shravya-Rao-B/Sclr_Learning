1.What is the purpose of passing an empty array as the second argument to the useEffect hook 
in React?

Options:
It specifies the values that the hook depends on, and the hook will only be executed if one of these values changes
It specifies the values that the hook depends on, and the hook will be executed every time the component renders
It specifies that the hook does not have any dependencies, and the hook will only be executed once
It specifies that the hook does not have any dependencies, and the hook will be executed every time the component renders

Ans:
It specifies that the hook does not have any dependencies, and the hook will only be executed once


2.
What will be the function of the below code?

import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

const DataFetcher = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => {
        console.log(data);
      });
  }, []);

  return <div>Data Fetcher</div>;
};

Options:
The component fetches data from an API and logs it to the console.
The component renders a loading spinner until the data is fetched.
The component renders a form for entering data and sends it to the server.
The component renders a list of fetched data items.

Ans:
The component fetches data from an API and logs it to the console.

3.Consider a React component that displays a count and has an “Increment” button.
 You observe that clicking the “Increment” button rapidly multiple times sometimes results in a 
 lower-than-expected count. What could be causing this issue?

 import React, { useState } from 'react';

function QuickUpdateIssue() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    // Simple useState call
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Quick Update Issue</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default QuickUpdateIssue;

Options:
The useState hook is not properly imported in the component.
React’s rendering is not efficient for fast updates.
The setCount function is being called directly with the current count.

Ans:
The setCount function is being called directly with the current count.

4.In React Router, how do you define routes using the component?

Options:
<Routes path="/about" component={About} />
<Routes><Route path="/about" element={<About />} /></Routes>
<Route path="/about" component={About} />
<Route path="/about"><About /></Route>

Ans:
<Routes><Route path="/about" element={<About />} /></Routes>
