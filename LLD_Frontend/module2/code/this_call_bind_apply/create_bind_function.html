Implement bind method below
THANOS has snapped the finger, use the bind method in such a way that now iron man should be able to snap the finger again.

Explanation:

1. You are given boilerplate JS code with the following objects:

const thanos = {
name: "THANOS",
snap: function () {
return this.name + " snapped the finger and half of the universe " + (this.name == "THANOS" ? "disappeared" : "came back")
}
}

const ironman = {
name: "IRON MAN"
}

console.log(thanos.snap())

2. Notice that ironman object doesn't have a snap method.
3. You need to utilise Javascript binding facility to make a binded function.
4. This function will be a bind of :
4.1. snap function from thanos object
4.2. and ironman object

A variable called 'bindedFunction' has been declared in the main function.
You need to update the main function and initialise the bindedFunction, such that the main function returns this bindedFunction.
Test cases will then be evaluated in the backend.

Hints:
1. Use the bind method to create a binded function that combines the snap method from Thanos and the ironman object: let bindedFunction = thanos.snap.bind(ironman);
2. Return the bindedFunction from the main function: return bindedFunction;

Solution Approach:
Hereâ€™s the solution approach in a concise manner:

1. Utilize bind method: Use the bind method on the snap function of the thanos object to create a binded function that preserves the context.

2. Bind with ironman object: Pass the ironman object as an argument to the bind method to bind the snap function to the ironman object.

3. Initialize bindedFunction: Assign the binded function to the bindedFunction variable using the syntax thanos.snap.bind(ironman).

4. Return binded function: Return the bindedFunction from the main function.

By following these steps, you should be able to utilize the bind method to create a binded function that allows Iron Man to snap the finger.
