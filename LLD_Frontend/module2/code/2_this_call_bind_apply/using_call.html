2.Implement a program that utilises call() method in Javascript to make the provided function work on different objects.

Explanation:
1. You have a main function that takes in 2 parameters:
1.1. obj -> A object with different set of values.
1.2. func -> A simple function that utilises the values from the object provided and returns a string.

2. You need to write a program using call() method, which makes the provided function 'func' use the object 'obj' to generate a string.
3. You then need to catch the returned string in the 'resultString' variable, which is then returned from the main function.

Note:
The value of obj and func will be totally different for all the test cases, so there is no scope of hard coding the problem.

Sample test case:

Input:
let obj = {
name: "bucky",
team: "Team Cap",
};
let func = function () {
return "Hello avengers this is " + this.name + " from " + this.team + " lets fight !";
};

console.log(main(obj, func))

Output:
Hello avengers this is bucky from Team Cap lets fight !

Hints:
Utilize call() method: Use the call() method on the func function to provide the obj object as the context (this).
2. Return the result: Return the result of the func.call(obj) expression from the main function.

Hereâ€™s the solution approach for the given problem:

1. Utilize call() method: Inside the main function:
- Use the call() method on the func function.
- Pass the obj object as an argument to the call() method to provide it as the context (this) for the function.

2. Return the result: Return the result of the func.call(obj) expression from the main function.
- This will ensure that the func function uses the values from the obj object and generates the desired string.
- The resulting string will be returned as the output of the main function.

By following these steps, you should be able to utilize the call() method to make the provided func function work on different objects (obj) and generate the expected string.
