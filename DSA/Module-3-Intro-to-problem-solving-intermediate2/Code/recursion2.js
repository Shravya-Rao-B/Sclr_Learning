1.
Implement pow(A, B) % C.
In other words, given A, B and C, Find (AB % C).
Note: The remainders on division cannot be negative. In other words, make sure the answer you return is non-negative.

Problem Constraints
-109 <= A <= 109
0 <= B <= 109
1 <= C <= 109

Input Format
Given three integers A, B, C.

Output Format
Return an integer.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = 2
B = 3
C = 3
Input 2:
A = 3
B = 3
C = 1

Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:
0

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
23 % 3 = 8 % 3 = 2
Explanation 2:
33 % 1 = 27 % 1 = 0

Expected Output
Enter your input as per the following guideline:
There are 3 lines in the input

Line 1 ( Corresponds to arg 1 ) : A single integer

Line 2 ( Corresponds to arg 2 ) : A single integer

Line 3 ( Corresponds to arg 3 ) : A single integer

Hints:
Hint 1:
You need to develop a solution better than O(n).
Think recursively. You can think of an example like 2^8. 
How many multiplications do you really need to evaluate 2^8?

Solution Approach 1:
There are two important things to note here:
1) Overflow situation: Note that if x is large enough, multiplying x to the answer might overflow in integer.
2) Multiplying x one by one to the answer is O(n). We are looking for something better than O(n).

If n is even, note the following:
x ^ n = (x * x) ^ n/2
Can you use the above observation to develop a solution better than O(n)?

2.
What is the time complexity of the following code snippet?

q. int function(int n){
    if ( n % 2 == 0){
        return 0
    }
    return function(n-1) + function (floor(n/2))
}


Options:
O(n)
O(logn)
O(1)
None of these
O(n^2)

Answer: O(logn)

Hints:
Observe the base case and floor of odd numbers of the recursive function.

The floor function will always result an odd number if the number is 2 power kâˆ’1 .
Hence the time complexity will be o(logn)

Given a number A, check if it is a magic number or not.

A number is said to be a magic number if the sum of its digits is calculated till a single digit recursively by adding the sum of the digits after every addition. If the single digit comes out to be 1, then the number is a magic number.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109



Input Format
The first and only argument is an integer A.



Output Format
Return an 1 if the given number is magic else return 0.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 83557
Input 2:

 A = 1291


Example Output
Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Sum of digits of (83557) = 28
 Sum of digits of (28) = 10
 Sum of digits of (10) = 1. 
 Single digit is 1, so it's a magic number. Return 1.
Explanation 2:

 Sum of digits of (1291) = 13
 Sum of digits of (13) = 4
 Single digit is not 1, so it's not a magic number. Return 0.

Example Output
Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Sum of digits of (83557) = 28
 Sum of digits of (28) = 10
 Sum of digits of (10) = 1. 
 Single digit is 1, so it's a magic number. Return 1.
Explanation 2:

 Sum of digits of (1291) = 13
 Sum of digits of (13) = 4
 Single digit is not 1, so it's not a magic number. Return 0.

 Hints:
 One approach is to recursively check the sum of digits until a single digit is left. 
Now, check if the number is 1, then it is a magic number. Else NOT.

Solution Approach:
One approach is to recursively check the sum of digits until a single digit is left.
Now, check if the number is 1, then it is a magic number. Else NOT.

Efficient Approach:

There is also a shortcut method to verify Magic Number.
The function will determine if the remainder of dividing the input by 9 is 1 or not.
If it is 1, then the number is a magic number.
The divisibility rule of 9 says that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9.
Therefore, if a number is divisible by 9, then, recursively, all the digit sums are also divisible by 9.
The final digit sum is always 9. An increase of 1 in the original number will increase the ultimate value by 1, making it 10, and the ultimate sum will be 1, thus verifying that it is a magic number.

Scaler solution:
solve: function(A) {
        if (A < 10) {
            return (A === 1) ? 1 : 0;
        }
        let digit_sum = 0;
        while (A > 0) {
            digit_sum += A % 10;
            A = Math.floor(A / 10);
        }
        return this.solve(digit_sum);
    }
